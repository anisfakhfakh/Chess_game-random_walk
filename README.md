# Chess_game-random_walk
A Random walk theory real life example.

This project is a part of a School project.
My other projects will be porgressively uploaded at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]
## Project Objective
The objective of this peoject is to implement a real life application of random walk. I have chosen a game using Chess to illustrate it.

### Methods Used
* Probability
* Random walk
* Chess
* Modelling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Matlab

## Project Description
The Game consists of placing the knight piece in an intial position and simulate its random movements giving a maximum number of movements. The knight movements are conditionned by the rules associated with the knight possivle moves. The simulation stops when the knight reaches the final destination (8,h) or when the maximum number of iterations is reached.
Giving 100 knights, we simulate each one knight and with each maximual number of movements, we associate the number of horses which reached the desired destination.
